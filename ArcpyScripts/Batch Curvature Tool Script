#Description:
#Creates curvature maps of rasters (DEMs in .TIFs) in a specific folder and renames them 
#original DEM tiles had names of "IslandsDEMv0_2x2m_zmasl_isn2016_47.tif"; script creates a curvature map of the tile and names it "tile47curv.tif"
#I used this to make a bunch of curvature maps of tiles from the Arctic DEM version 7: (http://atlas.lmi.is/mapview/?application=DEM)
#Script was run by entering "execfile(file location)" in Arcmap python window
